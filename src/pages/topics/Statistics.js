              Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps us make sense of large amounts of information and draw meaningful conclusions from data.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two main branches of statistics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Methods for summarizing and describing data through numerical calculations, tables, and graphs.</li>
              <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Methods for using sample data to make generalizations or predictions about a larger population.</li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Key Statistical Terms:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> The entire group of individuals or objects about which information is desired.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample:</strong> A subset of the population selected for study.</li>
                <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A characteristic or attribute that can be measured or categorized.</li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual values or observations collected for variables.</li>

              Understanding the type of data you're working with is crucial for choosing appropriate statistical methods.
            </p>
            <h3>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Qualitative (Categorical) Data:</strong> Data that can be sorted into categories based on some characteristic or attribute.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Nominal:</strong> Categories with no inherent order (e.g., colors, gender, blood types).</li>
                  <li><strong>Ordinal:</strong> Categories with a natural order (e.g., education levels, satisfaction ratings).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Quantitative (Numerical) Data:</strong> Data that represent amounts or quantities that can be measured.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Discrete:</strong> Data that can only take specific values, usually counts (e.g., number of children, number of cars).</li>
                  <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Data that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, time).</li>

              Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).
            </p>
            <h3>Basic Probability Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> A process that leads to one of several possible outcomes.</li>
              <li><strong>Sample Space (S):</strong> The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.</li>
              <li><strong>Event (E):</strong> A subset of the sample space.</li>
              <li><strong>Probability of an Event:</strong> P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Probability Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Complement Rule:</strong> P(E') = 1 - P(E)</li>
              <li><strong>Addition Rule:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>For mutually exclusive events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
                  <li>For non-mutually exclusive events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Example: Calculating Probability</h3>
              <p>
                A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards: 13 cards in each of 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Hearts and diamonds are red; clubs and spades are black.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the probability of drawing a heart?
                <br />
                P(heart) = Number of hearts / Total number of cards = 13 / 52 = 1/4 = 0.25
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the probability of drawing a red card or a king?
                <br />
                P(red) = 26 / 52 = 1/2
                <br />
                P(king) = 4 / 52 = 1/13
                <br />
                P(red and king) = 2 / 52 = 1/26 (there are 2 red kings)
                <br />
                P(red or king) = P(red) + P(king) - P(red and king) = 1/2 + 1/13 - 1/26 = 13/26 + 2/26 - 1/26 = 14/26 = 7/13 โ 0.538

          <div className="topic-content">
            <p>
              The normal distribution (also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve) is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean.
            </p>
            <h3>Properties of the Normal Distribution:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>It is symmetric around the mean.</li>
              <li>The mean, median, and mode are all equal.</li>
              <li>The total area under the curve is 1.</li>
              <li>It is completely determined by its mean (ฮผ) and standard deviation (ฯ).</li>
              <li>About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.</li>
              <li>About 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.</li>
              <li>About 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean (the "68-95-99.7 rule" or "empirical rule").</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Standard Normal Distribution (Z-distribution):</h3>
            <p>
              The standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We can convert any normal random variable X to a standard normal random variable Z using the formula:
            </p>
            <p className="equation">
              Z = (X - ฮผ) / ฯ
            </p>
            <div className="example-box">
              <h3>Example: Using the Normal Distribution</h3>
              <p>
                The heights of adult women in a certain population are normally distributed with a mean of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 3.5 inches.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Question 1:</strong> What percentage of women are taller than 70 inches?
                <br />
                First, convert 70 inches to a z-score:
                <br />
                Z = (70 - 65) / 3.5 = 5 / 3.5 โ 1.43
                <br />
                Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that P(Z > 1.43) โ 0.0764 or about 7.64%.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the height of a woman who is at the 90th percentile?
                <br />
                The 90th percentile corresponds to a z-score of about 1.28 (from a standard normal table).
                <br />
                Now, convert this z-score back to the original scale:
                <br />
                X = ฮผ + Z ร ฯ = 65 + 1.28 ร 3.5 = 65 + 4.48 = 69.48 inches

          <div className="topic-content">
            <p>
              Correlation and regression are used to analyze the relationship between two numerical variables.
            </p>
            <h3>Correlation:</h3>
            <p>
              Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>r = 1: Perfect positive correlation</li>
              <li>r = -1: Perfect negative correlation</li>
              <li>r = 0: No correlation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient is:
            </p>
            <p className="equation">
              r = ฮฃ[(x - xฬ)(y - ศณ)] / โ[ฮฃ(x - xฬ)ยฒ ร ฮฃ(y - ศณ)ยฒ]
            </p>
            <h3>Linear Regression:</h3>
            <p>
              Linear regression finds the line of best fit that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. The equation of the regression line is:
            </p>
            <p className="equation">
              ลท = a + bx
            </p>
            <p>
              Where:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>ลท is the predicted value of y</li>
              <li>a is the y-intercept</li>
              <li>b is the slope</li>
              <li>x is the value of the independent variable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The slope (b) can be calculated as:
            </p>
            <p className="equation">
              b = r ร (s_y / s_x)
            </p>
            <p>
              Where r is the correlation coefficient, s_y is the standard deviation of y, and s_x is the standard deviation of x.
            </p>
            <p>
              The y-intercept (a) can be calculated as:
            </p>
            <p className="equation">
              a = ศณ - b ร xฬ

                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate the means.
                <br />
                xฬ = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3
                <br />
                ศณ = (65 + 70 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 390 / 5 = 78
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate the correlation coefficient.
                <br />
                (Calculations omitted for brevity, but using the formula would give r โ 0.987)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the regression line.
                <br />
                The slope (b) โ 6.5
                <br />
                The y-intercept (a) = ศณ - b ร xฬ = 78 - 6.5 ร 3 = 78 - 19.5 = 58.5
                <br />
                So, the regression line is: ลท = 58.5 + 6.5x
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Use the regression line to make predictions.
                <br />
                For example, if a student studies for 6 hours, the predicted exam score would be:
                <br />
                ลท = 58.5 + 6.5 ร 6 = 58.5 + 39 = 97.5
